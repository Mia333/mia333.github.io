## Definition

Different from classification and object detection, segmentation describes the process of classifying each pixels to a certain class. Essentially, segmentation is pixel-level classification. According to fidelity of classification, it can be divided into the following areas: 


### Superpixels

Superpixels can be defined as a set of pixels, which has similary features such as color, texture.  Note here, one object can be split into several superpixels. One usual way to detct superpixels is SLIC(Simple linear iterative clustering), it was proposed by Achanta in 2010. The idea is to transform RGB image to CIELAB and 5D feature vector, then cluster pixels according to distance measured using 5D feature vector.



### Semantic segmentation

The goal of semantic image segmentation is to label *each pixel* of an image with a corresponding ***class*** of what is being represented. It doesn't different across different instances of the same object.



### Instance segmentation

Instance segmentation gives a unique label to every instance of a particle object in the image. For example, for dog1 in one image, it will will label it as dog1, dog2, dog3 , while semantic segmentation classifies it as one label dog. However, instance segmentation only cares about objects, it doesn't care about "stuff", such as sky, grass.



### Panoptic segmentation

It was first introduced in  by Kaiming He, cooperated FAIR and Heidelberg University  in 2018 . Panoptic segmentation will give every pixel a label and instance ID. It is a combination of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

## Evaluation

The performance of segmentation models can be evaluated in three aspects.



### 1. **Execution time**

Execution or speed is a key indicator for application, especially during inference time in the period of model deployment. Execution time is an indicator for algorithm efficiency and complexity. On the other hand, execution time is also effect by the hardware.



### 2. **Memory footprint**

Memory cost is an important consideration for real time application. For example, for a self driving car, there are a fixed number of GPUs allocated in one car, which is responsible for processing all modules, including perception, prediction, decision making, control. Obviously, the memory footprint should be limited.



### 3. Accuracy

Other than previous two criterion, there are several other metrics for evaluating segmentation performance.

 

* PA (Pixel Accuracy)

  the percent of pixels in the image which were correctly classified. 

  $$accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$$ 

* PC (Per-Class)

   accuracy measures the proportion of correctly labelled pixels for each class and then averages over the classes.
   
* MIoU (Mean Intersection over Union) / Jaccard Index 

  [Jaccard Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) measures the intersection over the union of the labelled segments for each class and reports the average.

  The `Jaccard index`, also known as Intersection over Union and the Jaccard similarity coefficient.
  $$a = q$$

* **IoU class:** Intersection over Union for each class 

  $$ IoU=TP/(TP+FP+FN) $$

* **iIoU class** ( Instance Intersection over Union ) 

  $$iIoU=iTP/(iTP+FP+iFN)$$

* **IoU category** (Intersection over Union for each category) 

  $$ IoU=TP/(TP+FP+FN)$$

* **iIoU category** (Instance Intersection over Union for each category) 

  $$iIoU=iTP/(iTP+FP+iFN)$$
